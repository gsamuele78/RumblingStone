## PART 1 — MONSTER ART GENERATION

### How to Generate Monster Art

Use any of these free/open tools to generate visual references for monsters at the table:

**Free AI art tools (2026):**
- **Stable Diffusion** (local, free): https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui
  Models: SDXL + realistic_vision for monster art; fantasy_worlds for environments
- **Comfy UI** (local, free): https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI — more control
- **Bing Image Creator** (free, web): https://www.bing.com/create — DALL-E based
- **Leonardo.ai** (free tier): https://leonardo.ai — good for fantasy subjects

**Upscaling free tools:**
- **Real-ESRGAN** (local): https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN — 4× upscale, open source
- **Upscayl** (desktop app, free): https://upscayl.org — GUI wrapper for ESRGAN
- **Topaz Gigapixel** (paid) — best quality for print

**Recommended workflow:**
```
1. Generate base image with SD/DALL-E (512×512 or 768×768)
2. Upscale 4× with Real-ESRGAN or Upscayl → 2048×2048
3. Crop to monster only; remove background (remove.bg or GIMP)
4. Save as PNG with transparency → use as VTT token in Owlbear Rodeo or Roll20
```

Rewards: [XP / loot / story rewards]
Connections: [Links to other quests]
```

---

### MAIN QUEST TREE — The Red Hand of Tiamat

```
QUEST: The Red Hand Marches
Type: Main AP
Hook: Session 1 opening — the PCs are in Rethmar or on the Old North Road / The Dawn Way when the first
      hobgoblin raids strike.

Stage 1: Stop the Advance Guard
  Goal: Defeat/route the hobgoblin advance and close Nimon Gap temporarily
  → Branch A (success): Gain 2 weeks before main horde arrives; Shaarcah Forest elves willing to talk
  → Branch B (partial): Gap only slowed; lose 1 week; elves remain neutral
  → Branch C (failure): Horde arrives early; Drellin's Ferry area burns AND Witchcross; start at −1 week

Stage 2A: The Skull Gorge
  Goal: Destroy or hold the Bridge (Skull Gorge equivalent)
  → Success: Horde must spend 5 days finding another crossing; party gains time for allies
  → Failure: Horde crosses; Drellin's Ferry is next target immediately
  Note: Even on failure, a partial success (slowing the horde) is valuable.

Stage 2B (parallel): Lhesper
  Goal: Eliminate Wyrmlord Koth in the Lhespenbog before he flanks Rethmar
  → Success: Lose the black dragon support; lizardfolk may flip to neutral
  → Failure: Koth flanks Rethmar during the final battle; adds +20% horde strength

Stage 3: The Ghostlord's Bargain
  Goal: Deal with the Lich of Vraath Keep
  → Diplomacy (DC 30 with preparation, DC 35 cold): Lich withdraws from the pact → loses 40
    wyverns from horde roster
  → Combat: Kill Wyrm Cultists guarding the lich's phylactery; destroy it; lich destroyed
  → Bad deal: Give him a living lion (his heart, original RHoD), but narrative cost: lich
    remains in the vale post-campaign as a neutral (and unpredictable) power

Stage 4: Battle of Rethmar
  Goal: Survive the assault; defeat Azarr Kul
  → Full victory: Azarr Kul slain; horde fragments; Tiamat's plan set back decades
  → Pyrrhic victory: Kul slain but Rethmar burns; survivors rebuild; vale scarred
  → Partial: Kul escapes; campaign continues with follow-up (see Villain Expansion below)

Rewards (full completion): +6,000 XP/PC; "Defenders of Cannath Vale" title; Vale Council grant
```

---

### ARTIFACT QUEST CHAINS

#### Quest Chain A — The Phylactery of Vraath Keep

```
QUEST: The Lich's Secret Heart
Type: Artifact (Major)
Artifact: Phylactery of the Lich of Vraath Keep
  A glass-and-bone orb, 6 inches diameter, warm to the touch, containing a spark of greenish
  witchfire. If the lich is destroyed while the phylactery exists, he reforms in 1d10 days.
  If destroyed, the lich dies permanently but releases 4d6×10 years of stored necrotic energy
  (everyone within 30 ft takes 10d6 negative energy damage, Fort DC 22 half).

Hook: Found in stage 3 of main quest (Vraath Keep) OR purchased from an underground dealer in
      Channathgate for 12,000 gp (he doesn't know what it is).

Stage 1: Identify the Phylactery
  → Spellcraft DC 28 or Legend Lore → reveals its nature and the lich's location
  → Branch A: Party wants to destroy it → Stage 2
  → Branch B: Party tries to use it as leverage → Diplomacy branch (see main quest Stage 3)
  → Branch C: Party sells it (!) → The buyer is a Red Wizard agent → Villain hook

Stage 2: The Destruction Ritual
  Goal: The phylactery cannot be destroyed by mundane means. Options:
  → Holy site destruction: Bring it to the Moonwatch Hill and have Sertieren perform a 3-hour
    ritual (requires 500 gp in components, party must defend against 3 waves of lich's undead)
  → Divine request: A cleric of Kelemvor or Torm of 9th+ level can destroy it with a special
    casting of Dispel Evil + Consecrate (combined effect) — costs 1,500 XP
  → Throw it into lava: There's no volcano nearby. Finding one is a separate mini-quest.

Stage 3: Consequence
  → Phylactery destroyed: Lich permanently dead; 500 XP per PC; lich's hoard (7,000 gp
    equivalent in gems and scrolls) now safely accessible in Vraath Keep
  → Lich freed from pact (diplomacy branch): He gives the party one free casting of a 7th-level
    spell (his choice) and withdraws from the vale. The phylactery remains hidden — unknown
    variable in future campaigns.

Connections: Main Quest Stage 3; Faction (Red Wizard agent Branch C)
```

#### Quest Chain B — The Five-Headed Talisman

```
QUEST: Azarr Kul's War-Standard
Type: Artifact (Minor)
Artifact: The Talisman of Five Fangs
  A medallion of black iron inlaid with five gemstones (black, blue, green, red, white)
  arranged like Tiamat's heads. Functions as a minor artifact:
  - +4 Charisma to anyone who worships Tiamat (evil only)
  - +2 Charisma to all others
  - 3/day: Command (as spell, DC 16) targeting non-Tiamat worshippers
  - 1/day: Cause Fear (DC 15) in a 20-ft burst
  - Curse: Non-evil wearers must make Will DC 18 each week or become increasingly obsessed
    with power and begin making suboptimal choices for personal gain

Hook: Found on Azarr Kul's body at the Battle of Rethmar (if he falls there)
      OR looted from his command tent in the Fane of Tiamat approach

Stage 1: What Is This?
  Identify (Spellcraft DC 25, Legend Lore, or consult Sertieren): Reveals talisman is a
  material anchor — destroying it here weakens Tiamat's direct influence on this crusade but
  does not destroy the horde.
  → Keep it: The curse begins; DM tracks weekly Will saves
  → Consecrate it: 2,000 gp + cleric of Torm/Tyr at 10th+ level; removes curse; item becomes
    a standard +2 CHA item that loses all special properties
  → Destroy it: See Stage 2

Stage 2: Destroying the Anchor
  Options (parallel to phylactery destruction logic):
  → Submerge in blessed water at a temple of Selûne: Temple of Selûne in Channathgate has a
    blessed spring; 3-hour ritual; Tiamat cultists will try to stop it (8 fanatics + 1 cleric)
  → Counter-ritual at the Shaarcah Forest's heart: Elves offer to unmake it through forest magic;
    requires party to return the elves' stolen sacred idol (Side Quest: The Taken Idol)

Stage 3: Consequence
  → Talisman destroyed: Horde loses morale cohesion bonus; in the final battle, EL drops by 2
  → Talisman kept and cursed PC: Eventually acts as a plot driver for a follow-up campaign
  → Talisman given to Red Wizard (mistake): Szass Tam now has a direct Tiamat connection

Connections: Main Quest Stage 4; Side Quest: The Taken Idol; Faction: Tiamat's Cult
```

---

### SECONDARY OBJECTIVE BANK

Use these as "B-plot" sessions, downtime adventures, or parallel tracks:

```
[1] THE TAKEN IDOL
A Shaarcah Forest elf sacred idol (a carved moonwood owl, worth 300 gp, divine focus for Rillifane
Rallathil) was stolen by hobgoblin scouts in Kythorn. The Conclave won't negotiate until it's
returned. The idol is in Wyrmlord Saarvith's tent in the western The Wyrmbones base camp (CR 10 encounter).
Reward: Shaarcah Forest Conclave becomes Allied (provides 12 scouts + forest intel for final battle)

[2] THE CRESSFALL ORPHANS
20 children from burned Drellin's Ferry area are sheltered in Rethmar's mill, under the care of a
traumatized halfling woman (Exp 1). Commander Sorann wants them evacuated to Channathgate
before the main assault. Escort mission — 3 days on the Old North Road / The Dawn Way, 2 random encounters.
Reward: 600 XP; the halfling's uncle is a fence in Channathgate who will identify items for free

[3] THE MURKMERE RIVER RUNNERS
A band of lizardfolk (8 warriors, Cpt at Ftr 3) is opportunistically raiding both sides —
they hate the hobgoblins as much as the humans. A PC with Handle Animal or Diplomacy (DC 22)
can recruit them as irregular allies. The catch: they demand 400 gp in "river toll" payment.
Reward (recruited): 800 XP; 8 lizardfolk skirmishers for the Battle of Rethmar (AC 15, 2 attacks)

[4] THE DESERTER'S CACHE
A hobgoblin sergeant named Grakh has deserted. He has his unit's logistical plans (maps of
supply depots, encoded in hobgoblin military script). Tracking him (Survival DC 18) and
convincing him to defect or extracting the plans is worth 2 weeks' advance intelligence:
DM may reveal one encounter from the next chapter before it occurs.
Reward: 700 XP; pre-knowledge of one upcoming encounter

[5] THE RED WIZARD OBSERVER
A Red Wizard named Zara Vel (Wiz 9, NE, Thay) is in Channathgate, quietly observing the invasion.
She is NOT helping the horde — she's evaluating whether Thay can exploit the chaos afterward.
Approach options: Ignore (she leaves; no consequence); Confront (she defends herself; CR 9);
Negotiate (she'll share intelligence on the horde's logistics for a favor owed to Thay — moral
weight here; accepting makes the party indebted to a Red Wizard)
Reward: Varies by approach; intel is worth 600 XP equivalent if extracted diplomatically

[6] THE MOONWATCH HILL RITUAL
Sertieren the Wise is trying to cast a sending to Silverymoon but the hobgoblin warcaster
(Wiz 7 equivalent) is running a magical interference ritual from the The Wyrmbones. The party
must reach and disrupt the interference site (a 2-day climb into the foothills; CR 8 encounter
with the warcaster and 4 gnoll bodyguards) so Sertieren's sending goes through.
Reward: 900 XP; Silverymoon responds with a wand of cure moderate wounds (21 charges) and
a promise to send a 10th-level wizard advisor within 2 weeks

[7] THE CULT OF THE DRAGON ADVANCE AGENT
A half-dragon (human base) Cult of the Dragon agent (Rgr 4 / Dragon Disciple 3) is in the vale,
creating a network of "safe houses" for surviving Wyrmlords to use after the campaign ends.
Finding the network (Investigation over 2 sessions) and dismantling it is a meta-campaign
objective that pays off in reduced difficulty in a potential follow-up campaign.
Reward: 1,000 XP; a Cult communication crystal worth 800 gp as an item; intel on the follow-up

[8] VRAATH HOLD'S VAULT (Exploration)
Vraath Keep is a ruin — but the original owners buried a vault beneath the courtyard. Finding
it requires: Research in Rethmar's mill-archive (Knowledge: History DC 18), then excavation
(8 hours, 4+ people), then bypassing a 100-year-old arcane lock (Disable Device DC 30 or
Knock). Inside: 3,200 gp in old Cormyrean coin, a +2 light fortification breastplate (old
Purple Dragon style), and a partial spellbook (3 2nd-level, 2 3rd-level spells; DM chooses).
```

## PART 3 — VILLAIN EXPANSION TEMPLATES

### Template Format
Each villain has a **base** (from RHoD) and an **expansion layer** (FR-integrated, harder).

---

**AZARR KUL — EXPANDED**

Base (RHoD): High Wyrmlord; final boss; Cleric 11 / Fighter 2
FR Expansion:
- **Tiamat's Voice**: 1/day, Azarr Kul can speak as Tiamat's direct mouthpiece; all creatures
  within 60 ft that hear the Voice must save (Will DC 22) or be Shaken for 1 minute
- **Five Aspects**: Each of his five chromatic dragon scale pauldrons grants a 1/day effect:
  Black=Acid Splash (4d6), Blue=Call Lightning (7d6), Green=Suggestion (DC 18),
  Red=Fireball (10d6 DC 19), White=Ice Storm (at CL 12)
- **Escape Contingency**: If reduced below 30 HP, Dimension Door to the Fane of Tiamat
  (inner sanctum); requires the party to fight through the Fane to finish the job
- **If He Escapes**: See follow-up hooks below.

Follow-up hooks if Azarr Kul escapes:
1. He retreats to a black site in the The Wyrmbones; begins rebuilding the horde (6-month timer)
2. He makes contact with Szass Tam — offers Tiamat's blessing in exchange for Thayan military support
3. He sends assassins (Worg-riding hobgoblin Rgr 6 pairs) to eliminate the PCs over the next month

---

**THE LICH OF VRAATH HOLD — EXPANDED**

The original "Ghostlord" was an old lion-themed druid. The Cannath Vale version is a
**Netherese-era lich** who made a pact with Azuth (not Lolth or a demon) for immortality
through an arcane adaptation of lichdom — he is Lawful Neutral, not evil. He was paid in
the promise that his knowledge would never be lost. The horde's Cult of Dragon agent tricked
him into the pact with Azarr Kul by presenting forged documents claiming Mystra endorsed it.

**Personality**: Cold, academic, occasionally sardonic. Not a murderer — just pragmatic.
**Motivation**: He wants his phylactery protected and his knowledge to persist. He would
rather have the party end the horde (disrupting his forced alliance) than continue.

**Expanded Negotiation** (replaces combat if PCs discover the deception):
- DC 15 Diplomacy to open dialogue (he's skeptical of living creatures)
- DC 22 Diplomacy to reveal the forged documents to him (party must find them first — in the
  Fane's war room, a side objective)
- If deception revealed: Lich immediately breaks the pact; withdraws support; tells party
  the Fane's layout in detail (tactical advantage: remove one ambush from the Fane)
- He asks only one thing: the party swears a magical oath (Geas, cast by him) to protect
  his library (100 unique 3rd–8th level arcane scrolls in Vraath Keep's vault)

---

**SAARVITH — EXPANDED (Surviving Wyrmlord)**

If Saarvith survives the campaign (not unusual given his ambush/escape tactics), he becomes
a recurring antagonist:
- Retreats to the Shaarcah Forest's eastern edge; begins a guerrilla campaign
- Recruits the remaining Koth lizardfolk as a small but effective swamp-raider force
- Has a personal grudge against any PC who killed his wyvern
- Will eventually seek employment from the Zhentarim (offers intelligence on the vale's
  defenses in exchange for protection and resources)
- Can be found and confronted 3 months post-campaign (Survival DC 22 to track into the
  Lhespenbog; CR 12 encounter with 12 lizardfolk + Saarvith at Rgr 8)

---

## PART 4 — FACTION ALLIANCE / OPPOSITION TRACKER

Copy this into each session log and update after major interactions:

```markdown
## Faction Status — Session [N]

| Faction | Standing | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Vale Council (Rethmar) | Neutral | Need military credibility first |
| Shaarcah Forest Conclave (elves) | Hostile | Will shift if idol returned |
| Lizardfolk (Lhespenbog) | Neutral | Mercenary; 400gp would buy them |
| Red Wizard (Zara Vel) | Neutral | Observing; can be leveraged |
| Zhentarim (Channathgate agent) | Neutral | Watching; could be enemy or tool |
| The Lich of Vraath Keep | Hostile (pact) | Shift possible if deception revealed |
| Silverymoon (distant) | Friendly | Sertieren's contact; slow to respond |
| Cult of the Dragon (local) | Enemy | Advance agent active; don't know PCs yet |
| Harper Cell (Channathgate) | Friendly | Overwhelmed; need PC support to act |

Faction Scales: Hostile / Unfriendly / Neutral / Friendly / Allied
Allied factions provide active military or logistical support in the Battle of Rethmar.
```

**Battle of Rethmar modifiers by Allied factions:**
- Vale Council + militia: +50 defenders (included by default)
- Shaarcah Forest Conclave: +12 elf scouts (ranged; devastating in the approach)
- Lizardfolk: +8 irregular skirmishers (melee; unreliable; may break if casualties are high)
- Silverymoon wizard: +1 high-level arcane caster (10th level Wiz) for the final battle
- Harper Cell activated: Intelligence on horde's approach route → first round of battle is not a surprise

## NOTES ON USING THE ORBITALFLOWER ARCHIVE FOR MAPS

The **Map-A-Week** series from WotC produced hundreds of grid maps (dungeon rooms, wilderness,
encounter sites) in GIF/JPG format, ideal for VTT play.

### Finding and Using a Map

1. Load https://orbitalflower.github.io/rpg/wizards-3e-archive.html
2. Ctrl+F for "Map-A-Week" — find the index section
3. Click the original Wizards URL → paste into Wayback Machine search:
   `https://web.archive.org/web/*/[original-url]`
4. Select a 2003–2006 snapshot → download the GIF/JPG
5. Import into Roll20 or Owlbear Rodeo as the battle map
6. Set grid to match (most WotC maps use 5-ft squares at approximately 50 or 100px/square)

### Recommended Map-A-Week archives for Cannath Vale

Search these terms in the orbitalflower index:
- "swamp" → for Lhespenbog encounters
- "bridge" → for Skull Gorge
- "fortress ruins" → for Vraath Keep
- "town" → for Rethmar scenes
- "mountain pass" → for Nimon Gap
- "forest" → for Shaarcah Forest encounters
