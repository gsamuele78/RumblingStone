- **Azarr Kul** (`Bestiario/villain/Azarr_Kul/`): High Wyrmlord of Tiamat. Half-Blue-Dragon Hobgoblin, Cleric 10/Fighter 4, GS 15. Commands the Red Hand horde and fights on foot — Tyrgarun (Old Blue Dragon, CR 18) is a separate sky-terror encounter, not his mount. Boss of Rethmar Phase 3.

- **Capitana Lorana** (`Bestiario/png/Lorana/`): Secondary NPC, GS 7. Fighter 6/Expert 2. Survivor of the initial Red Hand attack (Arc 00), led ~800 refugees to Rethmar. Non-official Council voice; her field intel is worth -1 CR to Phase 1 if shared with Thorik. Key reconnection NPC for all four PCs.
- **Consiglio di Rethmar** (`Bestiario/png/Consiglio_Rethmar/`): 7-member political body (Lady Kaal, Halveth, Jarmaath, Sorvane, Pyriel, Thornwall, Lorana). Default vote = surrender without party intervention. Three council sessions (Day 30/33/35) with concrete battle impact on all Rethmar phases.
