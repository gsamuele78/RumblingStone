Per-agent mirrors (`.claude/skills/`, `.cursor/skills/`, etc.) are
generated artifacts of `scripts/build-skills.sh` and are gitignored.
`.hb.md` files are generated Homebrewery layouts (`plans/adr/ADR-0003`):
regenerate via `dm.py recap --hype` / `dm.py handout`, never edit by hand.

> **DMs: start with `campaign/DM-CAMPAIGN-PLAYBOOK.md`.** It contains the
> pre/during/post-session workflow, worked examples for session files and
> `state.md` diffs, the `§0 Campaign Status At-a-Glance` dashboard, and the
> branch-per-group reset procedure (`scripts/new-campaign-group.sh`) for
> running this campaign with a new group.

## Skills

This repo ships focused skills plus one legacy meta-router.
AI agents that support SKILL.md will discover them automatically:

- `skills/dnd-35-srd/` — pure d20 SRD mechanics
- `skills/forgotten-realms-lore/` — Faerûn 1372 DR canon
- `skills/rumblingstone-campaign/` — this campaign (PCs, artifacts, arcs, coherence)
- `skills/rumblingstone-narrative-style/` — **mandatory for all content generation**: eight-pillar style engine (Salvatore prose, LotR depth, Casa di Davide destiny, Andor intrigue, GoT politics, Mercer table technique, BG3 echoes, BG1/2 quest design), PC protagonism in good and evil
- `skills/rumblingstone-mapmaking/` — map generation workflow (Watabou, templates, VTT export)
- `skills/rumblingstone-automation/` — `dm.py` CLI + session-state pipeline: session end wizard, per-PG recaps, next-session brief, canon writes only under the ADR-0007 triple constraint (group branch + confirmed diff + `auto:` regions)
- `skills/rumblingstone-plans/` — work-plan archive conventions (INDEX, gates, ADRs)
- `skills/rumblingstone-playtest/` — **come si collauda**: audit meccanico, dry-run cronometrato, schede di feedback, ciclo alfa → beta → collaudato ([ADR-0018](plans/adr/ADR-0018-apparato-uso-obbligatorio.md))
- `skills/rumblingstone-art-direction/` — **il mestiere dell'art director**: cosa hanno in comune tutte le immagini di un set (ancora storica in pubblico dominio, schede-personaggio, lock di seed/luce/camera) e **quando un'immagine si butta** invece di tenerla perché «è già venuta» ([ADR-0019](plans/adr/ADR-0019-licenza-dei-pesi-non-del-software.md))
- `skills/rumblingstone-debugging/` — systematic root-cause debugging for infrastructure ONLY (scripts/, CI, pytest, renderer, dm.py); vendored from obra/superpowers (MIT), policy in ADR-0010
- `skills/pathfinder-1e-srd/` — Pathfinder 1e rules, simple templates, CR benchmarks, 3.5↔PF1e conversion
- `skills/npc-villain-boosting/` — decision framework + workflow for boosting PNGs/villains/monsters
- `skills/dnd-35-rules/` — legacy meta-router; points to the skills above

When any agent answers a question:

1. Match the question to the skill (rules / lore / campaign).
2. Load that skill's `SKILL.md` first; follow its routing table.
3. For campaign questions, also load `campaign/state.md` and
   `skills/rumblingstone-campaign/references/campaign-coherence.md`.
4. Cite sources: SRD section, FRCS p.X, or `[Private — Red Hand of Doom, p.X]`.
5. **Never invent** stat blocks, spell effects, NPC stats, or artifact powers.
   Flag as `[INFERRED — needs DM confirmation]` instead.

## Campaign-Specific Conventions

### File naming

- Sessions: `campaign/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD_session-N.md`
- NPCs: `campaign/npcs/[name-kebab-case].md`
- Encounters: `campaign/encounters/[location-name]_encounter.md`

### NPC file format

```markdown
# [NPC Name]
**Role**: [villain / ally / neutral]
**Status**: [alive / dead / unknown]
**Location**: [current known location]
**Motivation**: [one sentence]
**CR**: [N] | **Race/Class**: [race, class N]
**Key stats**: HP X, AC Y, Attack +Z
**Notes**: [adaptation from RHoD original]
```

### Session log format

```markdown
# Session N — [Title] (YYYY-MM-DD)
**Players present**: [list]
**Location**: [in-world location]
## Summary
## Key decisions
## XP awarded
## Loot distributed
## Next session hooks
```

### Encounter file format

```markdown
# Encounter: [Name]
**Location**: [room/area]
**EL**: [N] | **CR breakdown**: [list monsters + CR]
**Terrain**: [description]
## Tactics
## Adaptations from RHoD original
## Read-aloud text (custom)
```

## Rules Adjudication Policy

1. **SRD first** — use d20srd.org for all rules lookups
2. **Non-SRD**: flag as `[Private source]`; do not reproduce copyrighted text verbatim
3. **House rules** live in `campaign/lore/house-rules.md` — always check before ruling
4. **RAW vs RAI**: state which you're providing; give both if ambiguous
5. **Red Hand of Doom adaptations**: documented in `campaign/lore/rhod-adaptations.md`
6. **DM Strategy & Player Profiles**: For adult-oriented, non-linear sessions (Shine Time, State Machine design), consult `skills/rumblingstone-campaign/references/campaign-dm-strategy.md` (canonical). The lore folder file `campaign/lore/dm-player-strategy.md` is now a pointer to that canonical source.
7. **Living world state**: Before describing what NPCs know, where parties/villains currently are, or what threads are open, load `campaign/state.md`. It is the single source of truth for *current* world state (changes per session).
8. **Coherence**: Before introducing artifact powers, NPC knowledge, or callbacks to past PG actions, consult `skills/rumblingstone-campaign/references/campaign-coherence.md`.
9. **Boosting PNGs/villains/monsters**: The campaign runs on D&D 3.5; Pathfinder 1e SRD material (simple templates, Monster-Statistics-by-CR benchmarks, NPC recipes) is an approved boost toolkit. Always go through `skills/npc-villain-boosting/` — it enforces the EL cap (≤ APL+4), the benchmark step, and the `Boost log:` requirement on named-NPC files. Never boost silently.
10. **Session lifecycle & canon writes**: Closing a session, updating `state.md`, generating recaps/briefs/teasers, or invoking anything in `scripts/` goes through `skills/rumblingstone-automation/` (single entrypoint `python3 scripts/dm.py`). Scripts may write canon ONLY under the ADR-0007 triple constraint: group branch (never `main`), DM-confirmed diff, and `<!-- auto: -->` marked regions of `state.md`. Everything else stays a printed proposal the DM applies by hand.
11. **Narrative content generation**: ANY request to generate quests, session prose, read-aloud/boxed text, NPC dialogue, hooks, recaps, or handouts MUST load `skills/rumblingstone-narrative-style/` (eight-pillar style engine) automatically — the user should never have to ask for "the style". It enforces the scene mixer (one lead pillar per scene), the PC Protagonism Test, the living-world rules (NPC/villain agency + SRD attitude mechanics — protagonism is the camera, not gravity), the Echo Ledger (`state.md` §7.E), and the BG1/2 quest-stage patterns. Coherence (rule 8) always beats style.

## For AI Agents: Key DO / DON'T

| DO | DON'T |
|---|---|
| Read session logs before generating continuations | Invent events that contradict session logs |
| Check `campaign/npcs/` before describing NPCs | Invent NPC stats not in files |
| Use 3.5 SRD for all mechanics | Use 5e rules (different system) |
| Load the focused skill for the question (`dnd-35-srd`, `forgotten-realms-lore`, …) | Quote non-SRD books verbatim |
| Close/prep sessions via `dm.py session` (ADR-0007) | Hand-edit `state.md` `auto:` regions or write canon on `main` |
| Flag 4e/5e Forgotten Realms lore as post-1372 DR | Present Spellplague as canon for this campaign |
| Preserve 3.5-era Faerûn canon (1372 DR) | Mix in FR lore from after 1385 DR |

## Supported Agents

The canonical skill source is the whole `skills/` tree (every directory with
a `SKILL.md`; `build-skills.sh` auto-discovers them). Per-agent mirrors are
**generated artifacts**, not committed to git (see `.gitignore`). Each
developer/CI runs the build pipeline locally:

- **Claude Code** → `.claude/skills/<skill>/` (compact.md format)
- **OpenAI Codex** → `.agents/skills/<skill>/` (machine.json)
- **GitHub Copilot** → `.github/copilot/skills/<skill>/` (compact.md)
- **Cursor** → `.cursor/skills/<skill>/` (machine.json)
- **Windsurf** → `.windsurf/skills/<skill>/` (compact.md)
- **Gemini** → `.gemini/skills/<skill>/` (structured.yaml)
- **ChatGPT** → `.chatgpt/skills/<skill>/` (compact.md)

Build commands:

```
./scripts/build-skills.sh           # build + deploy to ~/.<agent>/skills/
./scripts/build-skills.sh --no-deploy  # build only (CI)
./scripts/sync-skills.sh            # build + populate in-repo mirrors locally
```

**Automatic sync (no manual step needed):**

- **Claude Code** (web + CLI): `.claude/hooks/session-start.sh` (registered
  in `.claude/settings.json`) rebuilds and deploys ALL skill mirrors at the
  start of every session, **asynchronously** — the session starts at once
  while the build runs in background.
- **Stale-mirror protocol (async race guard)**: the hook writes
  `.claude/.skills-sync-status` (`syncing…` → `ok <sha> <ts>` | `failed`).
  Before the FIRST campaign-content generation of a session, the agent must
  check that file: if it is missing or not `ok`, **tell the user** the skill
  mirrors may be stale and ask whether to update now; on yes run
  `./scripts/build-skills.sh && ./scripts/sync-skills.sh --no-build`, then
  continue the conversation normally. If the user declines, proceed reading
  the canonical `skills/` tree directly (always current in git).
- **Other agents / plain git users**: run `./scripts/install-git-hooks.sh`
  once; it installs a `post-merge` git hook that resyncs the mirrors after
  every `git pull` that touches `skills/`.

Why mirrors aren't committed: they are 6× the source size (~3MB), drift over
time, and any agent that needs them can regenerate deterministically from
`skills/`. Treat `skills/` as the only thing humans edit.
